# Instructions
## Drawing a shape
The GUI consists of two tool bars on the upper and left sides of the frame, and a drawing panel. The Processing editor should have been updated with the setup function for the blank canvas, and an empty draw loop.
To select a shape to draw click a shape on the left tool bar, or right click it if it has three dots. Drag the mouse across the screen to create a shape from point a to b. The shape's button will remain selected until it is either clicked again, or the select button on the top toolbar is clicked.

## Editing a shape
This shape can be moved or stretched by clicking and dragging the shape or its edges respectively. Another option is to move the shape with the arrow keys, or right click on it to resize it, move it, or scan the popup menu for any other options. 
Shapes can also be deleted, copied, cut, or edited otherwise by using the upper tool bar, short cuts, or the previously mentioned pop up menu.

## Changing colours
The first four buttons of the upper toolbar are used for editing the fill or stroke of shapes. Select a shape first, and then select a colour in the popup menu to change the colour of a shape.
If choosing a colour from the fill button, click the shape you want to fill after, or use it to fill the background.

## Generating the drawing from Processing sketches
After modifying the code the canvas can be updated to reflect the changes by pressing the update button.
Keep in mind that the tool is expecting you to follow a certain format for your sketches where the setup function is first, followed by the draw function, and then any classes or other functions. If you do not follow this format the canvas might not look like what your sketch looks like at run time.

## Classes
To add shapes to a class, drag the mouse over the screen to select the intended shapes, then click the 'Group shapes' button. To edit a class right click on any shape in the class and chose from the available options.

## Animation
To animate a shape, click the animation button and select an animation, then click on a shape. The code will be updated and the animation will play when the code is running, but there will be no change in the drawing panel. 

## Buttons and links
To turn a shape into a button, click the action button and select the link or animation option. For the animation option the remaining steps are the same as to animate a shape. For the link option there will be a text field that popup where the full link with no quotation will need to be typed, press 'ok' and then the intended shape. The code will be updated but there will be no change in the appearance of the drawing or sketch.
